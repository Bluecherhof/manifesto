>And I say, see who is in there with you and celebrate. At this time in history, we are to take nothing personally, least of all ourselves. For the moment that we do, our spiritual growth and journey come to a halt.

>Die Zeit des einsamen Wolkfes ist vorüber.
>Versammelt Euch!
>The time of the lone wolf is over. Gather yourselves! Banish the word ’struggle’ from your attitude and your vocabulary. All that we do now must be done in a sacred manner and in celebration.

>We are the ones we’ve been waiting for.
